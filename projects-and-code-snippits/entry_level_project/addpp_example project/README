This is a minimalistic suggestion how a project could look like.
The build process is driven by a makefile.

The structure is as follows:
 - There is a single main entry point for the main program that
   is being developed. In the makefile this shall be defined
   using the MAINSRC variable. The ame of the executable is
   derived from this name.
 - In core.c (you are free to change the name and to add other
   files) we implement the core functionality (e.g., algorithms).
   All other files ought to be specified by the OTHERSRCS
   macro.
 - In core_test.c we implement the unit tests as own executable
   programs without using a fancy unit testing framework (you are
   however, free to use one). The main driver of the tests
   shall be specified by the 
 - In <program_name>.c we implement the main driver of the
   program. This is the program that shall be invoked by the user.
 - The makefile contains all flags and rules to build the program
   and tests and rules how to run the test. Important targets are
   "all", "build", "test", and "clean".

Feel free to adapt this layout for your own needs.
